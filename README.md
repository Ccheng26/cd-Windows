## Shortcuts

It'll take some getting used to, but the Command Key (⌘) is basically the Control Key (Ctrl), most of the equivalents for keyboard shortcuts are listed as such.

| Action       | Mac  | Windows           |
| ------------- | -----:|:-------------:|
| Cut        | ⌘ + X | Ctrl + X |
| Copy       | ⌘ + C | Ctrl + C |
| Select All | ⌘ + A| Ctrl + A |
| Paste      | ⌘ + V | Ctrl + V |
| Undo       | ⌘ + Z | Ctrl + Z  |
| Print      | ⌘ + P | Ctrl + P |
| Find       | ⌘ + F | Ctrl + F  |
| Find Again | ⌘ + G | Ctrl + G  |
| Open       | ⌘ + O | Ctrl + O  |
| Save       | ⌘ + S | Ctrl + S  |
| Close Front Window | ⌘ + W | Ctrl + W  |
| Quit App | ⌘ + Q | Alt + F4  |
... You get the idea, at little less intuitive:
| Action       | Mac  | Windows           |
| ------------- | -----:|:-------------:|
| Move Between Programs         | ⌘ + Tab           | Alt + Tab |
| Print Screen                  | ⌘ + Shift + 3     | WindowsKey + PrtScr (Screenshot will be in your Pictures folder as opposed to the Desktop) |
| Search                        | ⌘ + Space         | WindowsKey + Q (Will bring up Cortana) |
| New Finder (or File) Window   | ⌘ + N             | WindowsKey + E |
